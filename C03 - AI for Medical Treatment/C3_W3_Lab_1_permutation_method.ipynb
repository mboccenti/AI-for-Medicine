However, you might deduce that the predicted risk scores are greatly affected by how the Age column is rearranged. If we arrange it differently, then the model will predict different values and this might lead to a different c-index, and consequently a different value of the feature importance. To illustrate, let's import two more datasets with different permutations of the `Age` column. Since there is a random element when doing the permutation, the resulting order of the elements in the `Age` column will be different for each shuffle. You can see that in the two datasets below."
